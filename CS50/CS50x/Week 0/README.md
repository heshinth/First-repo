## Creating a Sratch project

My Scratch project is a simple pong game. A ball is bouncing all around, and we control the paddle to prevent the ball from falling down. We control the paddle using the mouse as input. The speed of the ball increases with every 10 points. The game ends when the ball falls to the bottom.
